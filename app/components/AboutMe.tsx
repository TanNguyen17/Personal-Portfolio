                Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
                Fast-forward to today, and I&aposve had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product studio.

                My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo.
                I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built well under the hood.
                In my free time, I&apos;ve also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.

                When I&aposm not at the computer, I&aposm usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds
